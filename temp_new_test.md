# Audio Synchronization Test Suite

## Test Purpose

**Validation Target**: [What requirements/design elements this test validates]

**Requirements Traceability**:
- Validates requirements: 
- Verifies design elements: 
- **CRITICAL**: All linked requirements and design elements must exist and be approved.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Red Phase (Failing Test)
```python
def test_basic_functionality_red():
    """
    Test Case: test_basic_functionality
    Requirement: REQ-F-XXX
    Acceptance Criterion: [From requirement specification]
    
    Expected: Test fails because functionality not implemented yet
    """
    # Given: [Preconditions from requirement]
    given_condition = setup_test_condition()
    
    # When: [Action from acceptance criteria]  
    result = system_under_test.perform_action(given_condition)
    
    # Then: [Expected outcome from requirement]
    assert result == expected_outcome_from_REQ_F_XXX
    # This should FAIL initially (Red phase)
```

### Green Phase (Minimal Implementation)
```python  
def test_basic_functionality_green():
    """
    Test Case: test_basic_functionality
    Requirement: REQ-F-XXX
    Implementation: DES-XXX
    
    Expected: Test passes with minimal implementation
    """
    # Given: [Same preconditions]
    given_condition = setup_test_condition()
    
    # When: [Same action]
    result = system_under_test.perform_action(given_condition)
    
    # Then: [Same expectation, now passing]
    assert result == expected_outcome_from_REQ_F_XXX
    # This should PASS with minimal implementation (Green phase)
```

### Refactor Phase (Improved Implementation)  
```python
def test_basic_functionality_refactor():
    """
    Test Case: test_basic_functionality
    Requirement: REQ-F-XXX, REQ-NF-XXX  
    Design: DES-XXX
    
    Expected: Test passes with optimized implementation
    """
    # Given: [Enhanced test conditions for non-functional requirements]
    given_condition = setup_enhanced_test_condition()
    
    # When: [Same action, potentially with performance/quality constraints]
    start_time = time.time()
    result = system_under_test.perform_action(given_condition)
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Then: [Functional + non-functional requirements satisfied]
    assert result == expected_outcome_from_REQ_F_XXX  # Functional requirement
    assert execution_time < max_time_from_REQ_NF_XXX  # Non-functional requirement
    # This should PASS with refactored, optimized implementation
```

## Requirements Coverage Analysis

### Functional Requirements Testing

#### REQ-F-XXX: [Requirement Title]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [From requirement specification]
- **Test Cases**:
  - `test_req_f_xxx_happy_path()` - Normal operation
  - `test_req_f_xxx_error_conditions()` - Error handling
  - `test_req_f_xxx_boundary_values()` - Edge cases
- **Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria

#### REQ-F-YYY: [Requirement Title]  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [From requirement specification]
- **Test Cases**:
  - `test_req_f_yyy_integration()` - Integration scenarios
  - `test_req_f_yyy_data_validation()` - Data constraints
- **Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria

### Non-Functional Requirements Testing

#### REQ-NF-XXX: [Performance Requirement]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [Performance thresholds from requirement]
- **Test Cases**:
  - `test_performance_under_normal_load()` - Expected load
  - `test_performance_under_peak_load()` - Maximum load
  - `test_performance_degradation_graceful()` - Overload behavior
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource usage

#### REQ-NF-YYY: [Security Requirement]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [Security controls from requirement]  
- **Test Cases**:
  - `test_authentication_mechanisms()` - Access control
  - `test_data_encryption()` - Data protection
  - `test_input_validation()` - Injection prevention
- **Coverage**: All security controls validated

## Design Element Verification

### Component Testing
- **DES-XXX Component**: Verified through unit tests
  - Interface contracts validated
  - Internal logic verified
  - Error handling confirmed

### Integration Testing  
- **Component Interactions**: Verified through integration tests
  - Data flow validation
  - Protocol compliance
  - System-level behavior

## Test Implementation

### Test Setup
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_setup():
    """Setup test environment per requirements and design specifications"""
    # Initialize system per DES-XXX design
    system = SystemUnderTest()
    
    # Configure per REQ-F-XXX requirements
    system.configure_per_requirements()
    
    return system
```

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Automated Execution**: All tests run in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Traceability Validation**: Verify requirement links before execution
3. **Coverage Measurement**: Ensure 100% requirement coverage
4. **Results Tracking**: Link test results back to requirements

### Test Data Management
- **Test Data**: Based on requirement specifications and acceptance criteria
- **Data Privacy**: Complies with REQ-NF-XXX privacy requirements  
- **Data Integrity**: Validates per DES-XXX data model constraints

## Compliance Validation

**IEEE 1012:2016 V&V Compliance**:
- ✅ Test cases derived from requirements
- ✅ Verification activities documented  
- ✅ Validation criteria defined
- ✅ Traceability to requirements maintained

**TDD Best Practices**:
- ✅ Tests written before implementation
- ✅ Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed
- ✅ Acceptance criteria directly tested
- ✅ Requirements traceability maintained

**Traceability Enforcement**: This test specification cannot be approved without:
1. ✅ Valid links to existing, approved requirements
2. ✅ Valid links to existing, approved design elements
3. ✅ Test cases covering 100% of linked requirement acceptance criteria
4. ✅ TDD approach documented and followed
5. ✅ IEEE 1012 V&V compliance demonstrated
