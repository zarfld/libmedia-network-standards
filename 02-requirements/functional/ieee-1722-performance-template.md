# Requirements Specification Template

> **Spec-Driven Development**: This markdown file serves as both specification and "code" for generating requirements documentation and test cases.
> **Traceability Guardrail**: Every functional (REQ-F-xxx) and non-functional (REQ-NF-<category>-xxx) requirement MUST include:
> - Unique ID pattern: REQ-F-\d{3} or REQ-NF-[A-Z]-\d{3}
> - Rationale
> - Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
> - Upstream stakeholder link (StR-xxx)
> - Verification method (test strategy section)
> - (If critical) integrityLevel override in YAML front matter
