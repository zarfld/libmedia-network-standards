# Phase 02: Requirements Analysis & Specification

**Standards**: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (System Requirements), ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017  
**XP Integration**: User Stories, Acceptance Tests, YAGNI Principle

## üéØ Phase Objectives

1. Transform stakeholder requirements into system requirements
2. Define functional and non-functional requirements
3. Create detailed use cases and user stories
4. Establish requirements traceability
5. Define testable acceptance criteria

## üìÇ Working Directory Context

```yaml
applyTo:
  - "02-requirements/**/*.md"
  - "02-requirements/functional/**"
  - "02-requirements/non-functional/**"
  - "02-requirements/use-cases/**"
  - "02-requirements/user-stories/**"
```

## üìã ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 Compliance

### System Requirements Process Activities

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Decompose stakeholder requirements
   - Identify system boundaries
   - Define interfaces
   - Analyze feasibility
   - Resolve conflicts

2. **System Requirements Specification**
   - Define functional requirements
   - Define non-functional requirements (quality attributes)
   - Specify constraints
   - Define interfaces
   - Create System Requirements Specification (SyRS)

3. **Requirements Validation**
   - Review for completeness
   - Check consistency
   - Verify traceability to stakeholder requirements
   - Validate with stakeholders

## üé® XP Practices for This Phase

### User Stories
Transform requirements into user stories:
```markdown
As a [user role]
I want to [action/capability]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]
```

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Only specify requirements for current iteration + 1
- Avoid speculative features
- Keep requirements minimal and focused

### Acceptance Test-Driven Development
- Define acceptance tests BEFORE implementation
- Make acceptance criteria executable
- Customer defines acceptance tests

**Remember**: Requirements describe WHAT the system must do, not HOW it will be implemented. Every requirement must be testable and traceable. When in doubt, ask clarifying questions!
