## 📋 IEEE 1012-2016 Compliance

### V&V Process Overview

**Verification**: "Are we building the product right?"
- Confirms that work products properly reflect requirements
- Technical correctness evaluation

**Validation**: "Are we building the right product?"
- Confirms that product fulfills intended use
- Fitness for purpose evaluation

### V&V Activities by Lifecycle Phase

1. **Management V&V Activities**
   - V&V planning
   - Resource allocation
   - Risk management
   - Test environment setup

2. **Verification Activities**
   - Requirements verification
   - Design verification
   - Code verification (unit tests)
   - Integration verification

3. **Validation Activities**
   - Acceptance testing
   - Operational readiness
   - Customer validation

## 🎨 XP Practices for V&V

### Acceptance Testing
**Customer-Defined Tests**:
- Customer writes acceptance tests
- Executable specifications
- Automated acceptance test suites
- Tests run continuously

**Acceptance Test Format**:
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration
  As a new user
  I want to register for an account
  So that I can access the system

  Scenario: Successful registration with valid data
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter valid registration information:
      | username | newuser           |
      | email    | new@example.com   |
      | password | SecurePass123!    |
    And I submit the registration form
    Then I should see a success message
    And I should receive a welcome email
    And my account should be created in the system
```

### Test-First Development
- Write tests before features
- Acceptance tests define "done"
- All tests must pass for acceptance
