**I want** [functionality]  
**So that** [business value]

### Acceptance Tests
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 2] 
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 3]

## Constraints

- **Technical**: [Any technical limitations]
- **Business**: [Any business constraints]
- **Regulatory**: [Any compliance requirements]

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- Links to stakeholder requirements (see traceability section)
- [Other system dependencies]

### Downstream Dependencies
