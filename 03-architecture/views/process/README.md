# Process View

Hardware-agnostic process view showing runtime behavior and component interactions.

## Key Processes

- Standards initialization with dependency injection
- Cross-layer message passing with timing guarantees  
- Hardware abstraction interface lifecycle

## Runtime Behavior

Standards components receive hardware interfaces via dependency injection and interact through well-defined protocols.
