# Physical View

Hardware deployment architecture emphasizing vendor independence.

## Deployment Patterns

- Standards layer: Identical across all hardware platforms
- Service layer: Hardware-specific per vendor (Intel, Broadcom, Marvell)
- Interface contracts: Consistent across all deployments

## Hardware Independence

Same standards code deploys across different hardware vendors without modification.
