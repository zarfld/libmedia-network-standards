# Development View

Hardware-agnostic development organization and build structure.

## Module Organization

- Standards layer: Pure IEEE protocol implementations
- Interface layer: Hardware abstraction contracts  
- Service layer: Hardware-specific implementations

## Build Dependencies

Standards modules compile independently of hardware-specific code through interface-based design.
