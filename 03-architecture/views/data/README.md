# Data View

Data flow and storage architecture maintaining hardware independence.

## Data Abstraction

- Protocol state: IEEE standards define all data structures
- Hardware data: Abstracted behind interfaces
- Cross-platform compatibility: Consistent data formats

## Hardware-Agnostic Data Flow

Same data structures and flow patterns work across all hardware platforms.
