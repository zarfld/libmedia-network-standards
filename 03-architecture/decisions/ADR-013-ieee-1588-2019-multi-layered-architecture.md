# ADR-013: IEEE 1588-2019 PTPv2 Multi-Layered Architecture with Hardware Abstraction

## Status

**Accepted** - January 27, 2025

## Context

IEEE 1588-2019 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) v2.1 requires enterprise-grade timing precision with sub-microsecond accuracy while supporting deployment across diverse hardware platforms including Intel x86, ARM embedded systems, and FPGA-based industrial controllers. The implementation must maintain deterministic behavior and strict timing requirements while remaining testable and maintainable across platforms.

### Key Technical Challenges

**Cross-Platform Timing Precision Requirements**:
- Sub-microsecond accuracy across Intel, ARM, and FPGA platforms
- Hardware timestamp utilization where available, software fallback otherwise
- Deterministic execution time regardless of underlying hardware capabilities
- Real-time performance guarantees for industrial and professional media applications

**Protocol Complexity Management**:
- IEEE 1588-2019 defines complex interactions between Ordinary Clock (OC), Boundary Clock (BC), and Transparent Clock (TC) modes
- Multi-domain support (0-127) with complete isolation requirements
- Enhanced security framework with authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Comprehensive management protocol with TLV extensibility

**Testing and Validation Requirements**:
- Protocol compliance verification independent of hardware platform
- Unit testing without physical hardware dependencies
- Integration testing with real hardware for timing accuracy validation
- Continuous integration pipeline supporting multiple target platforms

## Decision

Implement a **multi-layered architecture with strict hardware abstraction** using dependency injection patterns to separate IEEE 1588-2019 protocol logic from platform-specific timing operations.

### Interface Design Pattern

**Core Abstraction Interfaces**:

```cpp
namespace IEEE::_1588::_2019::hal {

// Network interface for packet transmission
class NetworkInterface {
public:
    virtual ~NetworkInterface() = default;
    virtual Result sendPacket(const PacketBuffer& packet, 
                             const NetworkAddress& destination) = 0;
    virtual Result receivePacket(PacketBuffer& packet, 
                                NetworkAddress& source, 
                                Timestamp& receivedAt) = 0;
    virtual bool supportsHardwareTimestamps() const = 0;
};

// Precision timing interface
class TimerInterface {
public:
    virtual ~TimerInterface() = default;
    virtual Timestamp getCurrentTime() const = 0;
    virtual Result setPeriodicTimer(TimerHandle& handle, 
                                   Duration interval, 
                                   TimerCallback callback) = 0;
    virtual nanoseconds getResolution() const = 0;
    virtual bool supportsHardwareClock() const = 0;
};

// Hardware clock synchronization interface
class ClockInterface {
public:
    virtual ~ClockInterface() = default;
    virtual Result adjustFrequency(const FrequencyAdjustment& adjustment) = 0;
    virtual Result setTimeOffset(const TimeOffset& offset) = 0;
    virtual ClockQuality getClockQuality() const = 0;
    virtual bool supportsPhaseAdjustment() const = 0;
};

} // namespace IEEE::_1588::_2019::hal
```

### Dependency Injection Implementation

**Protocol Layer Integration**:

```cpp
namespace IEEE::_1588::_2019::core {

class PTPEngine {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<hal::NetworkInterface> networkInterface_;
    std::unique_ptr<hal::TimerInterface> timerInterface_;
    std::unique_ptr<hal::ClockInterface> clockInterface_;
    
public:
    // Constructor dependency injection
    PTPEngine(std::unique_ptr<hal::NetworkInterface> network,
              std::unique_ptr<hal::TimerInterface> timer,
              std::unique_ptr<hal::ClockInterface> clock)
        : networkInterface_(std::move(network))
        , timerInterface_(std::move(timer))
        , clockInterface_(std::move(clock)) {}
    
    // Protocol implementation using abstractions
    Result synchronizeClock(const SyncMessage& syncMsg) {
        auto timestamp = timerInterface_->getCurrentTime();
        // ... IEEE 1588-2019 synchronization algorithm
        return clockInterface_->setTimeOffset(calculatedOffset);
    }
};

} // namespace IEEE::_1588::_2019::core
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Direct Hardware Integration

**Approach**: Implement IEEE 1588-2019 protocol with direct calls to platform-specific APIs.

**Advantages**:
- Maximum performance with no abstraction overhead

- Simpler build system with fewer dependencies

**Disadvantages**:
- Separate implementation required for each target platform
- Difficult to test without target hardware
- Protocol logic mixed with platform-specific code
- Standards compliance verification complicated by platform differences

**Rejection Reason**: Violates maintainability requirements and makes cross-platform support infeasible for a comprehensive IEEE 1588-2019 implementation.

### Alternative 2: Single Unified Implementation Layer

**Approach**: Implement all functionality in a single layer with compile-time platform selection.

**Advantages**:
- Simpler architecture with fewer layers
- Compile-time optimization opportunities
- Direct control over all implementation details

**Disadvantages**:
- Mixing of protocol and platform concerns
- Difficult to test individual components in isolation
- Complex conditional compilation management
- Reduced code reuse across platforms

**Rejection Reason**: Creates maintenance burden and violates separation of concerns principle essential for standards compliance verification.

### Alternative 3: Plugin-Based Architecture

**Approach**: Load platform-specific implementations as runtime plugins.

**Advantages**:
- Ultimate flexibility in platform support
- New platforms supported without recompilation
- Clear separation of platform-specific code

**Disadvantages**:
- Runtime overhead of plugin loading and dispatch
- Complex deployment and configuration management
- Security concerns with runtime code loading
- Not suitable for embedded systems with constrained resources

**Rejection Reason**: Complexity and security concerns outweigh benefits for IEEE 1588-2019 implementation requirements.
