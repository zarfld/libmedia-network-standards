# Architecture Evaluation

This document captures formal and lightweight evaluation of the architecture using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) concepts plus scenario-based reviews.

## Evaluation Metadata
```yaml
evaluationId: ARCH-EVAL-001
date: YYYY-MM-DD
participants:
  - Role: Architect
  - Role: Developer Lead
  - Role: Ops Lead
  - Role: Security Officer
methods:
  - atam-workshop
  - peer-review
scope: initial baseline architecture
```

## Business Drivers
Summarize top business / mission drivers and primary quality attribute priorities.

## Architecture Overview
Short recap of architecture (link to main architecture description & views). Provide diagram references instead of repeating.

## Quality Attribute Scenarios Evaluated
Reference scenarios from `architecture-quality-scenarios.md`.

| Scenario ID | QA | Current Risk | Sensitivity Points | Tradeoffs Observed |
|-------------|----|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| QA-SC-001 | Performance | Medium | Database latency, cache hit rate | Performance vs. consistency |
| QA-SC-002 | Availability | Low | Failover detection time | Availability vs. cost |
| QA-SC-003 | Security | Medium | Rate limiting thresholds | Security vs. user friction |

## ATAM Steps (Condensed)
1. Present business drivers
2. Present architecture
3. Identify architectural approaches
4. Generate quality attribute utility tree
5. Analyze architectural approaches (scenario walkthroughs)
6. Brainstorm & prioritize scenarios
7. Analyze prioritized scenarios
8. Identify risks, non-risks, sensitivity points, tradeoffs

## Utility Tree (Excerpt)
| QA | Scenario | Importance (H/M/L) | Difficulty (H/M/L) |
|----|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Performance | QA-SC-001 | H | M |
| Availability | QA-SC-002 | H | M |
| Security | QA-SC-003 | H | H |
| Maintainability | QA-SC-010 | M | L |

## Risks
| ID | Description | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Related Scenario |
|----|-------------|--------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| RISK-001 | Cache stampede under surge traffic | High | Medium | Add request coalescing | QA-SC-001 |

## Non-Risks
| Description | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Active-active multi-region not required Phase 1 | DR objectives satisfied by warm standby |

## Sensitivity Points
Places where a slight change has large QA impact.
| Element | Parameter | Impacted QA | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Database | Connection pool size | Performance | Throughput plateau after 100 connections |

## Tradeoffs
| Tradeoff | QAs Affected | Decision Reference | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|-------|
| Strong consistency vs. latency | Performance, Consistency | ADR-005 | Chose strong consistency for correctness |

## Findings Summary
Bulleted summary of key outcomes, approved decisions, deferred concerns.

## Action Items
| ID | Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|----|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| ACT-001 | Implement read replica strategy | DBA Lead | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |
