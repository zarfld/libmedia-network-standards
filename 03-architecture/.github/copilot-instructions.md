## 🆕 Guardrail Artifacts Added
To strengthen standards compliance and evaluability, the following mandatory (or strongly recommended) artifacts are now part of this phase:

| Artifact | Location | Purpose | Standard Alignment |
|----------|----------|---------|--------------------|
| ADR Template | `decisions/ADR-template.md` | Consistent decision capture | ISO 42010 Rationale / IEEE 1016 Decisions |
| Architecture Views Overview | `views/README.md` | Defines viewpoints & view consistency rules | ISO 42010 Viewpoints/Views |
| Quality Attribute Scenarios | `architecture-quality-scenarios.md` | Concrete measurable QA scenarios | ATAM / 29148 NFR Traceability |
| Architecture Evaluation | `architecture-evaluation.md` | ATAM-style evaluation record | Risk & Tradeoff Analysis |
| Architecture Review Checklist | `standards-compliance/checklists/architecture-review-checklist.md` | Exit / readiness review | 42010 completeness, 1016 review |

### Quality Attribute Scenario Requirements
Each prioritized quality attribute (e.g., Performance, Availability, Security, Scalability, Maintainability) MUST have at least one scenario defined using the structured template (`architecture-quality-scenarios.md`). Scenarios must:
- Trace to at least one Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF-*)
- Reference the affected View(s) and ADR(s)
- Contain measurable response criteria (no vague terms)
- Define validation method (benchmark, chaos test, security test, inspection, simulation)

### Evaluation Requirements
An initial architecture evaluation (`architecture-evaluation.md`) MUST:
- List evaluated scenarios and outcomes (utility tree excerpt)
- Identify risks, non-risks, sensitivity points & tradeoffs
- Provide actionable mitigation items
- Record approval status & participants

### View Consistency Rules (Summary)
See `views/README.md` for full rules. Highlights:
- Every component (ARC-C-*) appears in logical + at least one runtime/deployment related view.
- Every interface (INT-*) linked to a provider component and (if used) at least one consumer.
- Every ADR references at least one requirement OR scenario.
- No orphan quality scenarios (all tie to ADR + component + view).

## 🚨 Critical Requirements for This Phase

### Always Do
✅ Document all architectural decisions with ADRs  
✅ Create multiple views addressing different concerns  
✅ Trace architecture to requirements  
✅ Identify and document architectural risks  
✅ Define clear component interfaces  
✅ Consider XP's Simple Design principles  
✅ Ensure architecture supports testability (TDD)  
✅ Document constraints explicitly  
✅ Review with stakeholders  

### Never Do
❌ Create architecture without understanding requirements  
❌ Over-engineer for future needs (YAGNI)  
❌ Skip ADRs for significant decisions  
❌ Create circular dependencies  
❌ Ignore non-functional requirements  
❌ Design without considering testability  
❌ Forget to document alternatives considered  
❌ Create architecture that can't be refactored  

## 🔍 Clarifying Questions to Ask

### About Architecture Concerns
1. What are the primary quality attributes (performance, security, scalability)?
2. What are the acceptable trade-offs?
3. What parts of the architecture are most likely to change?
4. What are the integration requirements?

### About Technical Decisions
1. Are there existing systems we must integrate with?
2. Are there mandated technologies or platforms?
3. What is the team's expertise and experience?

**Questions**:
1. **Data Relationships**:
   - Do we have complex relationships requiring JOINs?
   - Is data structure fixed or highly variable?

2. **Query Patterns**:
   - What are the most common queries?
   - Do we need complex aggregations?
   - Are there full-text search requirements?

3. **Scalability Needs**:
   - Expected data growth rate?
   - Read vs. write ratio?
   - Geographic distribution needs?

4. **Consistency Requirements**:
   - ACID transactions required?
   - Eventual consistency acceptable?

5. **Team Expertise**:
   - Team experience with SQL vs. NoSQL?
   - Training budget available?

**Impact**: This decision affects:
- Development complexity
- Operational costs
- Scalability approach
- Data migration effort
```

## 📊 Architecture Quality Checklist

The architecture must be:
- [ ] **Traceable** - Linked to requirements
- [ ] **Feasible** - Can be implemented with available resources
- [ ] **Complete** - Addresses all significant requirements
- [ ] **Consistent** - No contradictions
- [ ] **Testable** - Supports automated testing
- [ ] **Maintainable** - Can be understood and modified
- [ ] **Scalable** - Meets growth projections
- [ ] **Secure** - Addresses security concerns
- [ ] **Simple** - No unnecessary complexity (XP principle)
- [ ] **Documented** - All decisions recorded with rationale

## 📊 Phase Entry Criteria

✅ System Requirements Specification (SyRS) approved  
✅ Key quality attributes prioritized  
✅ Technical constraints identified  
✅ Architecture stakeholders identified  

## 📊 Phase Exit Criteria

Add the following additional mandatory exit criteria:
- ✅ Quality attribute scenarios documented and validated for all prioritized attributes
- ✅ Architecture evaluation (ATAM-lite) performed and recorded
- ✅ Risks & tradeoffs explicitly captured (architecture-evaluation.md)
- ✅ Architecture review checklist completed (standards-compliance/checklists/architecture-review-checklist.md)
- ✅ No orphan elements (every component, ADR, scenario participates in traceability chain)

Traceability completeness rule:
```
Requirement (REQ-*) ↔ Scenario (QA-SC-*) ↔ ADR (ADR-*) ↔ Component (ARC-C-*) ↔ View(s) ↔ Test (planned/implemented)
```

Additions integrate with existing criteria; failure to satisfy any above blocks transition to Phase 04 unless explicitly risk-accepted.

## 🔗 Traceability

Augment existing traceability guidance with scenario layer:
```
REQ-NF-P-001
  → QA-SC-001 (Performance Latency)
    → ADR-002 (Adopt Redis Cache Layer)
      → ARC-C-007 (CacheService)
        → Logical / Process / Deployment Views
          → Performance Benchmark Test (TEST-PERF-001)
```

Include a machine-checkable matrix in `07-verification-validation/traceability/architecture-traceability-matrix.md` (see Phase 07 addition) for CI validation.

## 📚 Standards References

Add:
- **ATAM** (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) – Scenario-based evaluation
- **SAAM** (Scenario-Based Architecture Analysis Method) – Optional lightweight alternative

**Remember**: Architecture defines the high-level structure. Keep it simple (XP), document decisions (IEEE 42010), and ensure it addresses stakeholder concerns. Good architecture enables agility and testability!
