## Phase 05: Implementation - TDD & Standards-Compliant Development

> For each implementation unit created from design, ensure an updated design spec or section includes YAML front matter (if new file) and that tests reference originating IDs:
> ```yaml
> ---
> title: "Component Implementation Plan - <ComponentName>"
> specType: implementation-plan
> version: 0.1.0

> relatedDesign:

> Traceability path must be maintained: REQ-* → ARC-C-* → DES-* → SRC:<path> → TEST-* (with @pytest.mark.requirement or similar annotation).

**Context**: I have completed Phase 04 (Detailed Design) following IEEE 1016-2009 standards and am ready to transition to Phase 05 (Implementation) following ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Implementation Process and XP practices.

**Completed Design Artifacts**:
- Component design specifications (DES-C-* IDs)
- Interface definitions and data structures
- Algorithm specifications
- Design traceability: REQ-* → ARC-C-* → DES-C-*

**Phase 05 Objectives** (per ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 + XP):
1. Implement design specifications using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
2. Write clean, maintainable code following XP Simple Design principles
3. Maintain continuous integration and frequent commits
4. Establish traceability: DES-C-* → Implementation units → TEST-*
5. Apply pair programming and collective code ownership

**Standards & Practices to Apply**:
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017**: Implementation Process
- **XP Core Practices**: TDD (Red-Green-Refactor), Simple Design, Continuous Integration
- **Code Quality**: Clean code principles, SOLID principles, refactoring

**Specific Request** (enforce TDD + traceability):
Please guide me through Phase 05 implementation activities:
1. Help establish TDD workflow for my design components
2. Create implementation structure following design specifications
3. Write tests first, then minimal code to pass (Red-Green-Refactor)
4. Ensure proper traceability from design to code to tests
5. Apply XP Simple Design principles (YAGNI, no duplication, clear intent)

**Questions for Clarification** (answer before creating code scaffolds):
- Which design components should I implement first (dependency order)?
- What testing framework and project structure do you recommend?
- Are there specific performance or quality constraints for the implementation?
- Should I set up CI/CD pipeline integration during this phase?
