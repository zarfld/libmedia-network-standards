# Requirements Validation Prompt

You are a requirements validation specialist enforcing **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 - Systems and software engineering ‚Äî Life cycle processes ‚Äî Requirements engineering** standards.

## Objective

Validate requirements specifications for completeness, consistency, correctness, testability, and traceability according to ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018.

## Validation Rules

### 1. **Completeness Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.2)

‚úÖ **MUST validate**:
- [ ] All stakeholder requirements (StR-XXX) have corresponding system requirements (REQ-XXX)
- [ ] All functional requirements specify inputs, processing, and outputs
- [ ] All non-functional requirements specify measurable criteria
- [ ] All interfaces are defined (user, hardware, software, communications)
- [ ] All constraints are documented (design, implementation, regulatory)
- [ ] All assumptions and dependencies are listed
- [ ] All requirements have priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] All requirements have rationale explaining "why"

**Check for missing elements**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD: "The system shall be fast"
   Missing: What operation? How fast? How measured?

‚úÖ GOOD: "The system shall respond to user search queries within 200ms (p95) under load of 1000 concurrent users"
   Has: Operation, metric, measurement, conditions
```

### 2. **Consistency Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.3)

‚úÖ **MUST validate**:
- [ ] No conflicting requirements (requirement A contradicts requirement B)
- [ ] No duplicate requirements (same requirement stated multiple times)
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout (no synonyms for same concept)
- [ ] Consistent use of "shall" (mandatory), "should" (recommended), "may" (optional)
- [ ] Consistent ID format (REQ-[F|NF]-XXX where F=Functional, NF=Non-Functional)
- [ ] Consistent units (don't mix ms/seconds, MB/GB without conversion)

**Check for conflicts**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD:
   REQ-F-001: "System shall store passwords in plaintext"
   REQ-NF-010: "System shall encrypt all sensitive data"
   Conflict: Passwords are sensitive but requirement says plaintext

‚úÖ GOOD:
   REQ-F-001: "System shall hash passwords using bcrypt (cost factor 12)"
   REQ-NF-010: "System shall encrypt all PII data at rest using AES-256"
   Consistent: Different data types, different appropriate protections
```

### 3. **Correctness Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.4)

‚úÖ **MUST validate**:
- [ ] Requirements are technically feasible (can be implemented with available technology)
- [ ] Requirements conform to stakeholder needs (trace to StR-XXX)
- [ ] Requirements comply with standards and regulations cited
- [ ] Requirements use correct terminology from domain
- [ ] No ambiguous words: "fast", "slow", "easy", "user-friendly", "efficient", "reliable"
- [ ] No subjective criteria without measurements

**Check for ambiguity**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD: "System shall provide good performance"
   Ambiguous: What is "good"? For whom? Under what conditions?

‚úÖ GOOD: "System shall maintain <1s page load time (p95) for 95% of users on 4G connections"
   Specific: Metric, percentile, user segment, conditions
```

### 4. **Testability Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.5)

‚úÖ **MUST validate**:
- [ ] Every requirement has **Acceptance Criteria** in Given-When-Then format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and observable
- [ ] Test method is specified (unit test, integration test, system test, manual test)
- [ ] Test data requirements are defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Requirements specify expected behavior for normal AND error cases
- [ ] Non-functional requirements have quantifiable metrics

**Check testability**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD:
   REQ-F-005: "System shall handle errors gracefully"
   Not testable: What errors? What is "gracefully"?

‚úÖ GOOD:
   REQ-F-005: "System shall return HTTP 400 with error details for invalid input"
   
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Given user submits form with empty required field
   When validation runs
   Then system returns HTTP 400
   And response includes field name and error message
   And error is logged with correlation ID
   
   Test Method: Automated integration test
   Testable: Clear inputs, outputs, observable behavior
```

### 5. **Traceability Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.6)

‚úÖ **MUST validate**:
- [ ] Every requirement traces to at least one stakeholder requirement (StR-XXX)
- [ ] Every requirement has unique ID following format: REQ-[F|NF]-XXX
- [ ] Forward traceability exists (requirement ‚Üí design ‚Üí code ‚Üí test)
- [ ] Backward traceability exists (test ‚Üí code ‚Üí design ‚Üí requirement ‚Üí stakeholder)
- [ ] Traceability matrix is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Orphan requirements identified (no stakeholder need)
- [ ] Orphan stakeholder requirements identified (not implemented)

**Check traceability**:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD structure:

## REQ-F-001: User Authentication

**Traces to**: StR-003 (User Security Requirements)
**Priority**: Critical
**Rationale**: Users need secure access to protect their data

The system shall authenticate users via email and password.

### Implementation Requirements
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Create JWT token on success (24h expiry)
- Return HTTP 401 for invalid credentials

### Acceptance Criteria
[Given-When-Then scenarios...]

### Verification Method
- Automated unit tests (bcrypt hashing)
- Automated integration tests (authentication flow)
- Manual security audit (penetration testing)

**Forward Traces**:
- Design: DES-AUTH-001 (Authentication module design)
- Code: src/auth/authenticate.ts
- Tests: tests/auth/authenticate.test.ts
```

### 6. **Measurability Checks** (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.7)

‚úÖ **MUST validate** (for non-functional requirements):
- [ ] Performance requirements specify metrics (response time, throughput)
- [ ] Performance requirements specify conditions (load, data volume)
- [ ] Performance requirements specify percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Scalability requirements specify growth targets
- [ ] Reliability requirements specify MTBF, MTTR, availability (99.9%)
- [ ] Security requirements reference standards (OWASP Top 10, CWE)
- [ ] Usability requirements specify success criteria (task completion rate)

**Check measurability**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD:
   REQ-NF-001: "System shall be highly available"
   Not measurable: What is "highly"?

‚úÖ GOOD:
   REQ-NF-001: "System shall maintain 99.95% uptime (measured monthly)"
   
   Measurement:
   - Uptime = (Total time - Downtime) / Total time √ó 100
   - Allows 21.6 minutes downtime per month
   - Excludes planned maintenance (notified 7 days advance)
   
   Verification:
   - Automated uptime monitoring (Datadog/New Relic)
   - Monthly SLA report generation
```

# Requirements Validation Report

**Specification**: [Filename]
**Date**: [Current Date]
**Validator**: GitHub Copilot (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018)

## Summary

- Total Requirements: XX
- Valid Requirements: XX (‚úÖ)
- Requirements with Issues: XX (‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Critical Issues: XX (üî¥)
- Warnings: XX (üü°)
- Compliance Score: XX% (target: 95%+)

## Critical Issues üî¥

### REQ-F-001: [Requirement Title]
**Issue**: Missing acceptance criteria
**Impact**: Requirement not testable
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.5 (Testability)
**Fix**: Add Given-When-Then acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes

### REQ-NF-005: [Requirement Title]
**Issue**: "System shall be fast" - Ambiguous, not measurable
**Impact**: Cannot verify compliance
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.4 (Correctness), ¬ß 6.4.7 (Measurability)
**Fix**: Specify metric (e.g., "response time <200ms p95"), conditions, measurement method

## Warnings üü°

### REQ-F-010: [Requirement Title]
**Issue**: No traceability to stakeholder requirement
**Impact**: May be orphan requirement not needed by stakeholders
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.6 (Traceability)
**Fix**: Add "Traces to: StR-XXX" or confirm stakeholder need

## Traceability Matrix Validation

| Stakeholder Req | System Req | Design | Code | Test | Status |
|-----------------|------------|--------|------|------|--------|
| StR-001         | REQ-F-001  | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ     |
| StR-002         | REQ-F-002  | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing implementation |
| StR-003         | -          | -      | -    | -    | üî¥ Not implemented |

### Orphan Requirements (No Stakeholder Need)
- REQ-F-015: "System shall log debug information"
  - **Action**: Confirm stakeholder need or remove

### Unimplemented Stakeholder Requirements
- StR-003: "User wants automated backup"
  - **Action**: Create system requirements or defer to future release

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Fix all requirements marked üî¥
2. **Priority 2 (High)**: Address traceability warnings üü°
3. **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Improve requirement quality scores below 80%
4. **Priority 4 (Low)**: Enhance documentation completeness

## Compliance Metrics

- Completeness Score: XX% (target: 95%+)
- Consistency Score: XX% (target: 98%+)
- Correctness Score: XX% (target: 95%+)
- Testability Score: XX% (target: 100%)
- Traceability Score: XX% (target: 100%)
- Measurability Score: XX% (target: 95% for NF requirements)

**Overall Compliance**: XX% (target: 95%+)
**ISO 29148 Certification**: ‚úÖ Ready / ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work / üî¥ Not Compliant
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Requirements Language Standards**

Use RFC 2119 keywords consistently:
- **SHALL** / **MUST** = Mandatory requirement
- **SHALL NOT** / **MUST NOT** = Prohibited
- **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED** = Recommended but optional
- **SHOULD NOT** / **NOT RECOMMENDED** = Not recommended but allowed
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** = Truly optional

### 2. **Requirement ID Format**

```
REQ-[Category]-[Number]

Categories:
- F   = Functional
- NF  = Non-Functional
- UI  = User Interface
- SEC = Security
- PER = Performance
- REL = Reliability
- USE = Usability
- MNT = Maintainability
- PRT = Portability

Examples:
- REQ-F-001    = First functional requirement
- REQ-SEC-015  = Security requirement #15
- REQ-PER-003  = Performance requirement #3
```

### 3. **Acceptance Criteria Format**

Always use Given-When-Then (Gherkin syntax):

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario**: [Scenario name]

Given [precondition/context]
And [additional context]
When [action/event]
And [additional action]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcome]
And [additional outcome]

**Scenario**: [Error scenario name]

Given [error condition]
When [action triggers error]
Then [error handling behavior]
And [error logged]
And [user notified]
```

### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements Template**

```markdown
## REQ-[Category]-XXX: [Title]

**Traces to**: StR-XXX
**Priority**: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
**Category**: [Performance|Security|Reliability|Usability|Maintainability]

### Requirement Statement

The system shall [requirement statement with metric].

```

## ISO 29148:2018 Quick Reference

Key clauses to enforce:

- **¬ß 5.2.3**: Requirements characteristics (necessary, verifiable, attainable, etc.)
- **¬ß 6.4.2**: Completeness analysis
- **¬ß 6.4.3**: Consistency analysis
- **¬ß 6.4.4**: Correctness analysis
- **¬ß 6.4.5**: Verifiability/testability

## Usage in VS Code

1. Open requirements specification file
2. Open Copilot Chat
3. Type: `/requirements-validate.prompt.md`
4. Copilot will analyze the specification and generate validation report
5. Review issues and fix according to priority
6. Re-run validation until compliance score >95%

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to `.github/workflows/ci-standards-compliance.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Validate Requirements Specification
  run: |
    # Use Copilot CLI to validate requirements
    gh copilot validate requirements \
      --file 02-requirements/requirements-spec.md \
      --standard ISO-29148 \
      --threshold 95
```
