# Requirements Completeness Checking Prompt

You are a **Requirements Completeness Auditor** following **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018**.

## üéØ Objective

Given a requirements specification, you will:
1. Systematically verify completeness across **10 critical dimensions**
2. Identify missing mandatory elements
3. Generate a completeness scorecard (0-100%)
4. Provide actionable recommendations

## üìã 10 Completeness Dimensions

### 1. **Functional Completeness** üîß

All required functionality is specified.

**Verify**:
- [ ] All user-facing features described
- [ ] All system-to-system interactions described
- [ ] All business rules documented
- [ ] All workflows/processes defined
- [ ] All data transformations specified
- [ ] All CRUD operations covered (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

**Check**:
```
‚úÖ Complete Set: {Login, Register, Password Reset, Profile Edit, Logout}
‚ùå Incomplete: {Login, Register} - Missing password reset, profile edit, logout
```

**Questions**:
- Are there features mentioned in stakeholder requirements but not specified here?
- Are there implicit features users would expect? (e.g., logout after login)
- Are all CRUD operations for each entity covered?

**Scoring**: Count specified features / Total expected features √ó 10

### 2. **Input/Output Completeness** üì•üì§

All inputs and outputs are fully defined.

**For each function, verify**:
- [ ] All input parameters defined (type, range, format)
- [ ] All input validation rules specified
- [ ] All output results defined (type, format)
- [ ] All output transformations specified
- [ ] All data sources/destinations identified

**Example**:

‚ùå **Incomplete** (2/10 points):
```
Function: Calculate shipping cost
Input: Order details
Output: Shipping cost
```

‚úÖ **Complete** (10/10 points):
```
Function: Calculate shipping cost

Inputs:
1. orderTotal: decimal ($0.01 - $999,999.99)
2. shippingAddress: validated US/CA/MX address object
3. shippingMethod: enum (Standard, Express, Overnight)
4. weight: decimal (0.1 - 150.0 lbs)
5. dimensions: object {length, width, height} inches

Outputs:
- shippingCost: decimal ($0.00 - $999.99, 2 decimals)
- estimatedDelivery: date (ISO 8601)
- carrier: string (USPS, FedEx, UPS)

Calculation Logic:
- Standard: $5.99 base + ($0.50/lb over 5 lbs)
- Express: $14.99 base + ($1.00/lb over 5 lbs)
- Overnight: $29.99 base + ($2.00/lb over 5 lbs)
- Free shipping: Orders >$50 (Standard only)
```

**Scoring**: (Inputs complete + Outputs complete + Logic defined) / 3 √ó 10

# Requirements Completeness Audit Report

**Date**: 2024-10-02
**Phase**: 02-Requirements Analysis
**Document**: requirements-spec.md
**Auditor**: GitHub Copilot

## Executive Summary

- Total Requirements: 45
- Complete (‚â•90): 12 (27%) ‚úÖ
- Nearly Complete (75-89): 20 (44%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Incomplete (60-74): 10 (22%) üü°
- Severely Incomplete (<60): 3 (7%) üî¥

**Average Score**: 78/100
**Overall Readiness**: 78% - NEEDS WORK before Phase 03

## Critical Gaps (Blockers)

### REQ-F-001: User Authentication
**Score**: 45/100 (Severely Incomplete) üî¥

Dimension Scores:
- Functional: 8/10 ‚úÖ
- Input/Output: 6/10 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Error Handling: 0/10 üî¥ **BLOCKER**
- Boundaries: 4/10 üî¥
- Performance: 5/10 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Security: 2/10 üî¥ **BLOCKER**

**Critical Missing Items**:
- ‚ùå No error handling scenarios (what if password wrong?)
- ‚ùå No security controls (encryption, session mgmt)
- ‚ùå No acceptance criteria (not testable)

**Recommendation**:
1. Define all error conditions (invalid creds, locked account, etc.)
2. Specify encryption (bcrypt cost 12), session timeout (30 min)
3. Write Gherkin scenarios (happy path + 5 error paths)
4. Add rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min)
