# Requirements Refinement Prompt

You are a **Requirements Quality Assurance Expert** following **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018**.

## üéØ Objective

Given a draft requirement, you will:
1. Identify quality issues across **8 quality characteristics**
2. Ask targeted clarifying questions
3. Suggest specific improvements
4. Rewrite the requirement to meet ISO 29148 quality standards

## üìã 8 Quality Characteristics (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 ¬ß 5.2.3)

### 1. **Complete** ‚úÖ

Every requirement must provide ALL necessary information.

**Check for**:
- [ ] Missing conditions or constraints
- [ ] Undefined terms or acronyms
- [ ] Incomplete scenarios (only happy path)
- [ ] Missing boundary values
- [ ] Undefined error handling
- [ ] Missing acceptance criteria

**Example**:

‚ùå **Incomplete**:
```
The system shall authenticate users.
```

**Questions**:
- Authenticate using what method? (password, OAuth, biometrics?)
- What happens on failure?
- How many failed attempts allowed?
- What is session timeout?

‚úÖ **Complete**:
```
The system shall authenticate users via email and password:
- Password hash: bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Max failed attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Account lockout: 30 minutes after 5 failures
- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Remember me: Optional 30-day persistent session
```

### 2. **Consistent** üîÑ

Requirements must not contradict each other.

**Check for**:
- [ ] Conflicting requirements
- [ ] Inconsistent terminology (same concept, different names)
- [ ] Contradictory constraints
- [ ] Overlapping responsibilities

**Example**:

‚ùå **Inconsistent**:
```
REQ-001: System shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256
REQ-045: Database passwords shall be stored in plaintext for admin recovery
```

These contradict! Plaintext violates encryption requirement.

‚úÖ **Consistent**:
```
REQ-001: System shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256
REQ-045: Database passwords shall be hashed with bcrypt (cost 12) and stored in encrypted database
```

### 3. **Correct** ‚úîÔ∏è

Requirements must accurately reflect stakeholder needs.

**Check for**:
- [ ] Misunderstanding of business need
- [ ] Technical solution imposed prematurely (HOW instead of WHAT)
- [ ] Requirements that don't solve actual problem

**Example**:

‚ùå **Incorrect (Premature Solution)**:
```
The system shall use Redis cache to improve performance.
```

This specifies HOW, not WHAT. The need is performance, not Redis.

**Questions**:
- What is the actual performance problem?
- What response time is needed?
- Redis may not be the best solution.

‚úÖ **Correct (States Need)**:
```
The system shall return search results within 500ms (95th percentile) for queries with ‚â§1000 results.
```

(Redis is a design decision, not a requirement)

### 4. **Feasible** üéØ

Requirements must be technically and economically achievable.

**Check for**:
- [ ] Impossible constraints (violate laws of physics)
- [ ] Conflicting non-functional requirements
- [ ] Unrealistic timelines or budgets
- [ ] Unavailable technology

**Example**:

‚ùå **Infeasible**:
```
The mobile app shall work without any internet connection and sync data in real-time with server.
```

This is contradictory! No internet = no real-time sync.

**Questions**:
- Do you mean offline-first with eventual sync?
- What latency is acceptable for sync when online?

‚úÖ **Feasible**:
```
The mobile app shall:
1. Work offline with full functionality using local storage
2. Sync data with server within 30 seconds when internet connection is restored
3. Show sync status indicator (synced, syncing, offline)
```

### 5. **Necessary** üé™

Every requirement must contribute to system goals. No "gold plating."

**Check for**:
- [ ] Nice-to-have features disguised as requirements
- [ ] Requirements without clear business justification
- [ ] Over-specified constraints

**Example**:

‚ùå **Unnecessary**:
```
The login form shall have a gradient background with smooth CSS animations.
```

**Questions**:
- Does this contribute to business goals?
- What problem does this solve?
- Is this UX design, not a requirement?

‚úÖ **Necessary**:
```
The login form shall be accessible to users with visual impairments, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support
```

(This is necessary for compliance and inclusivity)

### 6. **Unambiguous** üîç

Requirements must have exactly ONE interpretation.

**Ambiguous words to avoid**:

| ‚ùå Avoid | ‚úÖ Use Instead |
|---------|---------------|
| fast, quick, rapid | < 2 seconds (95th percentile) |
| large, small | > 1MB, < 100 records |
| user-friendly | ‚â§3 clicks, WCAG 2.1 AA |
| robust, reliable | 99.9% uptime, MTBF >1000 hours |
| secure | AES-256 encrypted, MFA required |
| flexible, scalable | Handles 10,000 concurrent users |
| approximately, about | Exact number or range (50-60) |
| should, might | "shall" (mandatory) or "may" (optional) |

**Example**:

‚ùå **Ambiguous**:
```
The system should respond quickly to user requests.
```

**Questions**:
- How quickly? (1 second? 10 seconds?)
- For which requests?
- What percentile? (average, 95th, 99th?)
- Under what load?

‚úÖ **Unambiguous**:
```
The system shall return API responses within 500ms for 95% of requests under normal load (‚â§1000 concurrent users).
```

### 7. **Verifiable (Testable)** üß™

Must be possible to objectively verify requirement is met.

**Check for**:
- [ ] Subjective criteria (e.g., "beautiful", "intuitive", "user-friendly")
- [ ] No measurable success criteria
- [ ] Cannot write a test case
- [ ] No way to measure compliance

**Example**:

‚ùå **Not Verifiable**:
```
The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to use.
```

How do you test "intuitive"? Everyone has different opinions.

**Questions**:
- What specific usability metric?
- What is success threshold?

‚úÖ **Verifiable**:
```
The system shall enable 95% of first-time users to complete account registration within 3 minutes without assistance, as measured by usability testing with ‚â•20 participants.
```

(This can be measured objectively)

### 8. **Traceable** üîó

Requirements must be uniquely identifiable and linked.

**Check for**:
- [ ] No unique identifier (e.g., REQ-F-001)
- [ ] No link to stakeholder requirement
- [ ] No link to acceptance criteria
- [ ] No rationale or justification
- [ ] No priority

**Example**:

‚ùå **Not Traceable**:
```
Users can reset passwords.
```

‚úÖ **Traceable**:
```markdown
## REQ-F-AUTH-003: Password Reset via Email

**ID**: REQ-F-AUTH-003
**Priority**: High (P1)
**Status**: Approved
**Stakeholder Requirement**: STR-SEC-001 (User Account Security)
**Rationale**: 30% of support tickets are password resets; self-service reduces support costs by $50K/year

**Description**: 
Registered users shall be able to reset forgotten passwords via email verification link valid for 1 hour.

**Acceptance Criteria**: TEST-AUTH-003-01 to TEST-AUTH-003-05

**Traceability**:
- **From**: STR-SEC-001
- **To**: DES-AUTH-007 (Password Reset Service Design)
- **Tests**: TEST-AUTH-003-*
```

## üîç Refinement Process

### Step 1: Analyze Draft Requirement

**Input**:
```
Draft: "The system shall be secure and protect user data."
```

### Step 2: Identify Quality Issues

- ‚ùå **Complete**: Missing specifics (what data? how to protect?)
- ‚ùå **Unambiguous**: "Secure" is vague
- ‚ùå **Verifiable**: Cannot test "be secure"
- ‚ùå **Traceable**: No ID, no stakeholder link
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Correct**: Too broad, needs decomposition

### Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

1. **Completeness**: What specific data needs protection?
   - Passwords, PII, payment info, session tokens?
   
2. **Completeness**: How should data be protected?
   - Encryption? Access control? Audit logs?
   
3. **Unambiguous**: What encryption standard?
   - AES-128, AES-256, RSA?
   
4. **Verifiable**: What security compliance standard?
   - OWASP Top 10, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS?
   
5. **Traceable**: Which stakeholder requirement?
   - STR-SEC-XXX?

### Step 4: Rewrite Requirement

‚úÖ **Refined**:
```markdown
## REQ-SEC-001: Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest

**ID**: REQ-SEC-001
**Priority**: Critical (P0)
**Status**: Approved
**Stakeholder Requirement**: STR-SEC-002 (Data Protection)
**Rationale**: GDPR Article 32 compliance (Security of Processing)

### Description

The system shall encrypt the following sensitive data at rest using AES-256-GCM:

1. **User Credentials**
   - Passwords: bcrypt hash (cost factor 12)
   - MFA secrets: TOTP seeds (AES-256-GCM)

2. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers  
   - Physical addresses
   - Date of birth

3. **Financial Data**
   - Credit card numbers: Tokenized via Stripe (PCI-DSS compliant)
   - Bank account numbers (if stored): AES-256-GCM

4. **Session Data**
   - Session tokens: Encrypted in Redis (AES-256-GCM)
   - API keys: Encrypted in database (AES-256-GCM)

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with automatic annual rotation
- **Key Access**: Application service account only, all access logged

### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: User passwords are encrypted
  Given a new user registers with password "SecureP@ss123"
  When user data is stored in database
  Then password is stored as bcrypt hash (cost 12)
  And raw password is never stored in plaintext
  And database inspection shows only bcrypt hash

Scenario: PII is encrypted at rest
  Given user profile contains email "user@example.com"
  When data is stored in database
  Then email is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
  And direct database query shows encrypted ciphertext
  And decryption requires proper credentials

Scenario: Encryption keys are secure
  Given application needs to encrypt data
  When encryption keys are accessed
  Then keys are retrieved from AWS KMS
  And keys are never stored in application code
  And all key access is logged with timestamp, user, action
```

### Verification Method

1. **Database Inspection**: Query database directly
   - `SELECT password FROM users` ‚Üí Should show bcrypt hash
   - `SELECT email FROM users` ‚Üí Should show encrypted ciphertext
   
2. **Encryption Key Audit**: Verify key management
   - Keys stored in AWS KMS only
   - Annual key rotation enabled
   - Key access logs available
   
3. **Penetration Testing**: 
   - Attempt to decrypt data without proper credentials
   - Verify no plaintext exposure in logs, memory dumps, backups

### Compliance

- **GDPR Article 32**: Security of Processing
- **OWASP A02:2021**: Cryptographic Failures
- **PCI-DSS 3.2**: Requirement 3 (Protect Stored Cardholder Data)

### Traceability

- **From**: STR-SEC-002 (Data Protection)
- **To**: DES-SEC-005 (Encryption Service Design)
- **Tests**: TEST-SEC-001-* (10 test cases)
```
