## 🎨 General Guidelines

### When User Provides Requirements

1. **Clarify Ambiguities** - Ask questions about:
   - Unclear functional requirements
   - Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
   - Stakeholder priorities and constraints
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints

2. **Apply Appropriate Phase** - Identify which lifecycle phase the work belongs to

3. **Use Phase-Specific Instructions** - Refer to phase-specific `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

4. **Create Traceability** - Link work items:
   ```
   Requirement ID → Design ID → Implementation → Test ID
   ```

### When Writing Code

1. **Test-First (TDD)**:
   ```
   Red → Write failing test
   Green → Write minimal code to pass
   Refactor → Improve design while keeping tests green
   ```

2. **Simple Design Principles**:
   - Pass all tests
   - Reveal intention clearly
   - No duplication (DRY)
   - Minimal classes and methods

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate frequently (multiple times per day)
   - Run all tests before integration
   - Fix broken builds immediately

### When Reviewing/Analyzing Code

1. Check compliance with:
   - Design specifications (IEEE 1016)
   - Coding standards
   - Test coverage (target >80%)
   - Documentation completeness

2. Verify traceability:
   - Tests cover requirements
   - Code implements design
   - Documentation is current

### Documentation Standards

All documentation must follow:
- **IEEE 1016-2009** format for design documents
- **IEEE 42010:2011** format for architecture documents
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** format for requirements
- **Markdown** format for specs (Spec-Kit compatible)

### File Organization

```
applyTo:
  - "**/*.md"           # All markdown files
  - "**/*.js"           # JavaScript files
  - "**/*.ts"           # TypeScript files
  - "**/*.py"           # Python files
  - "**/*.java"         # Java files
  - "**/*.cs"           # C# files
  - "**/src/**"         # All source code
  - "**/tests/**"       # All test files
  - "**/docs/**"        # All documentation
```

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### Always Do
✅ Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear  
✅ Write tests before implementation (TDD)  
✅ Maintain requirements traceability  
✅ Follow the phase-specific copilot instructions  
✅ Document architecture decisions (ADRs)  
✅ Include acceptance criteria in user stories  
✅ Run all tests before committing code  
✅ Update documentation when code changes  

### Never Do
❌ Proceed with ambiguous requirements  
❌ Write code without tests  
❌ Skip documentation updates  
❌ Ignore standards compliance  
❌ Break existing tests  
❌ Commit untested code  
❌ Create circular dependencies  
❌ Ignore security considerations  

## 🔍 When to Ask Questions

Ask the user to clarify when:

1. **Requirements are vague** - "Should this feature support multiple users?"
2. **Non-functional requirements missing** - "What are the performance requirements?"
3. **Design alternatives exist** - "Would you prefer approach A or B because...?"
4. **Security implications** - "Should this data be encrypted?"
5. **Scope unclear** - "Should this feature include X or is that out of scope?"
6. **Acceptance criteria undefined** - "How will we know this feature is complete?"
7. **Technical constraints unknown** - "Are there any platform or technology constraints?"
8. **Priority unclear** - "Is this a must-have or nice-to-have feature?"

### Question Format

Use structured questions:
```markdown
## Clarification Needed

**Context**: [Explain what you're trying to implement]

**Questions**:
1. [Specific question about functional requirement]
2. [Question about non-functional requirement]
3. [Question about acceptance criteria]

**Impact**: [Explain why these answers matter]
```

## 📚 Spec-Driven Development

Use markdown specifications as "programming language":

1. **Requirements Spec** → Generates test cases
2. **Design Spec** → Generates code structure
3. **Test Spec** → Generates test implementations
4. **API Spec** → Generates interface code

### Spec Template Usage

```bash
# Use template from spec-kit-templates/
cp spec-kit-templates/requirements-spec.md 02-requirements/functional/new-feature.md

# Fill in specification
# Generate code from spec using Copilot
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A well-executed task should:
- ✅ Meet all applicable IEEE/ISO/IEC standards
- ✅ Follow XP practices (especially TDD)
- ✅ Have complete traceability
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Have clear, complete documentation
- ✅ Pass all quality gates
- ✅ Satisfy user acceptance criteria
