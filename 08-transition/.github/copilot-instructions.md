                          ‚Üì
                    Keep or Rollback
```

### 3.2 Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Green Environment
```bash
# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/production-green/

# Wait for pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l version=green --timeout=300s
```

#### Step 2: Database Migration
```bash
# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate:production

# Verify migration
npm run db:verify
```

#### Step 3: Smoke Tests
```bash
# Run smoke tests against green environment
npm run test:smoke -- --env=production-green

# Verify all critical paths
```

#### Step 4: Traffic Switch
```bash
# Gradually shift traffic: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
kubectl patch service myapp-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green","percentage":"10"}}}'

# Monitor for 10 minutes
# Check metrics: error rate, latency, throughput

# If all good, increase to 50%
kubectl patch service myapp-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green","percentage":"50"}}}'

# Monitor for 10 minutes

# If all good, switch to 100%
kubectl patch service myapp-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'
```

#### Step 5: Monitor
```bash
# Monitor key metrics for 1 hour
- Error rate < 0.1%
- Latency p95 < 200ms
- CPU < 70%
- Memory < 80%
```

#### Step 6: Decommission Blue (After 24 hours)
```bash
# Scale down blue environment
kubectl scale deployment myapp-blue --replicas=1

# After 1 week with no issues, delete blue
kubectl delete deployment myapp-blue
```

## 4. Rollback Plan

### 4.1 Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- P95 latency > 500ms
- Critical functionality broken
- Security incident
- Data corruption

### 4.2 Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Immediate traffic switch back to blue
kubectl patch service myapp-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'

# Verify blue is serving traffic
curl https://api.example.com/health

# Rollback database (if needed)
npm run db:rollback

# Notify stakeholders
./scripts/notify-rollback.sh
```

‚úÖ Verify backups before deployment  

### Never Do
‚ùå Deploy without testing  
‚ùå Deploy without rollback plan  
‚ùå Deploy during peak hours  
‚ùå Skip user notification  
‚ùå Ignore post-deployment monitoring  

## üìä Phase Exit Criteria

‚úÖ System deployed to production successfully  
‚úÖ Smoke tests passing in production  
‚úÖ User documentation complete  
‚úÖ Operations manual complete  
‚úÖ Users and operators trained  
‚úÖ Support processes established  
‚úÖ Monitoring and alerts operational

‚úÖ Operational readiness review completed  

## üéØ Next Phase

**Phase 09: Operation & Maintenance** (`09-operation-maintenance/`)

---

**Remember**: Deployment is not the end! Monitor closely, respond quickly to issues, and support your users. Small, frequent releases reduce risk (XP practice).
