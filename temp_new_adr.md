## Context

**Problem Statement**: [Clear description of the problem or need]

**Requirements Context**: 
- This decision directly addresses requirements: 
- **CRITICAL**: All linked requirements must exist and be approved before this ADR can be approved.

## Decision

**We will** [clear statement of the architectural decision]

**Because** [primary rationale for the decision]

## Rationale

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: [Alternative 1]
- **Pros**: [Benefits]
- **Cons**: [Drawbacks]
- **Requirements Impact**: [How this affects linked requirements]

#### Option 2: [Alternative 2]  
- **Pros**: [Benefits]
- **Cons**: [Drawbacks]
- **Requirements Impact**: [How this affects linked requirements]

#### **Selected Option**: [Chosen Alternative]
- **Rationale**: [Why this option was selected]
- **Requirements Satisfaction**: [How this satisfies all linked requirements]

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative Consequences  
- [Risk 1 and mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2 and mitigation strategy]

### Requirements Traceability Impact
- **Requirements Satisfied**: [List how each linked requirement is addressed]
- **New Requirements**: [Any new requirements this decision creates]
- **Changed Requirements**: [Any requirements this decision modifies]

## Implementation

### Design Elements Required
- [Component/Interface 1] - Will implement REQ-F-XXX
- [Component/Interface 2] - Will implement REQ-NF-XXX

### Testing Strategy
- [Test approach 1] - Will verify REQ-F-XXX
- [Test approach 2] - Will verify REQ-NF-XXX

## Compliance

**IEEE 42010:2011 Compliance**:
- ✅ Addresses stakeholder concerns through requirements linkage
- ✅ Provides architectural rationale
- ✅ Documents decision context and alternatives

**Traceability Enforcement**: This ADR cannot be approved without:
1. ✅ Valid requirement links to existing, approved requirements
2. ✅ Clear rationale for architectural choice
3. ✅ Implementation and testing strategy
4. ✅ Impact analysis on linked requirements

- [ ] ADR ID follows ADR-NNN format and is unique
- [ ] All linked requirements exist and are approved  
- [ ] Decision rationale is technically sound
- [ ] Implementation strategy is feasible
- [ ] Testing approach validates requirements
- [ ] IEEE 42010 compliance is demonstrated
